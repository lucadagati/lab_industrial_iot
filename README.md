#IoT Communication Protocols: CoAP, MQTT, WAMP, and WoT
This repository covers the fundamentals of four popular Internet of Things (IoT) communication protocols: CoAP, MQTT, WAMP, and WoT. Each protocol has its unique features and use cases, making it suitable for specific applications in the IoT ecosystem.

CoAP
<a name="coap"></a>

CoAP is a web transfer protocol designed for constrained devices and networks, often used in low-power IoT devices. It is a lightweight protocol that follows a client-server model and supports RESTful web services.

Features:

UDP-based communication.
Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.
Built-in discovery mechanism.
Asynchronous message exchange.
Low overhead and parsing complexity.
Use cases:

Smart home and building automation.
Environmental monitoring.
Energy management.
MQTT
<a name="mqtt"></a>

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol built on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It uses a publish-subscribe model, which allows devices to communicate indirectly through a central broker. MQTT is known for its low-bandwidth, low-latency communication and is widely used in IoT applications.

Features:

Publish-subscribe architecture.
Low bandwidth and latency.
Quality of Service (QoS) levels for message delivery.
Last Will and Testament feature for handling unexpected disconnections.
Retained messages for storing the latest message on a topic.
Use cases:

Remote monitoring and control.
Vehicle telematics.
Healthcare monitoring.
WAMP
<a name="wamp"></a>

WAMP is a protocol that provides both Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and publish-subscribe communication patterns. It enables the development of distributed and real-time systems by combining the best features of CoAP and MQTT.

Features:

WebSocket and HTTP transport.
Supports both RPC and pub-sub communication patterns.
Cross-language and cross-platform.
Scalable and extensible through routers and components.
Use cases:

Real-time applications.
Cross-platform and cross-language systems.
Smart cities and infrastructure management.
WoT
<a name="wot"></a>

WoT (Web of Things) is not a protocol but a framework that extends the World Wide Web to the IoT world. It standardizes the way devices describe and expose their functionalities, enabling seamless integration with the existing web infrastructure.

Features:

Device descriptions using Thing Description (TD) documents.
Standardized data models and communication patterns.
RESTful, CoAP, MQTT, and WebSocket support.
Semantic interoperability with other IoT ecosystems.
Use cases:

Interoperability between different IoT platforms.
Smart home and building automation.
Industrial IoT applications.
This repository contains example projects and demos for each of these protocols. You can explore and learn more about each protocol by studying the code and trying out the examples.
